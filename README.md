# Hospital Day Care Bed and Patient Mangement App

An AngularJS app to help run a typical hospital daycare facility, where there are medical procedures performed on beds and a queue where waiting patients are assigned treatment on First Come First Served basis.
The App consists of two dashboards, one for the admins, used for registering inbound patients and tracking bed availability, and the other a patient dashboard, which informs waiting patients, their expected wait times and action items.
The aim of this app is to help the hospital have a higher thoroughput and for the patients to have a better and informed experience.
